description: Children props only re-render when the parent that provides them re-renders

In React, when a component re-renders, all of its descendents re-render.

However, there's an unintuitive case that's worth taking into account: the `children` prop.

If a component receives `children` as a prop, the `children` will not re-render when it re-renders. Rather, `children` will re-render when the component re-renders _that provided `children` as a prop_ to the other component.

Consider the example below. Note that `Parent` takes a `children` prop, which is provided to it by `GrandParent`.

As the user clicks the button rendered by `Parent`, the `count` state variable will change, causing `Parent` to re-render. However, the `Child` component, which `Parent` receives via the `children` prop, will not re-render. Instead, `Child` will re-render when `GrandParent` re-renders.

```
function GrandParent() {
    return (
        <Parent>
            <Child />
        </Parent>
    )
}

function Parent({ children }) {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    return (
        <div>
            <span>Count is {count}</span>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(prev => prev + 1)}>
                Increment count
            </button>
            {children}
        </div>
    )
}
```
